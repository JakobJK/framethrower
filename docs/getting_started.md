## Development Environment

- Change hosts settings to get the https://local-pwa.framethrower.io URL

## Install Dependencies

Unfortunate currently we have to go to the root of each JavaScript package and num

```npm install```

(That is for package/pwa, package/postgraphile, package/serverless)

## 1Password

We utilize 1Password not only to share passwords for different services, but also to have a single place where we can have securely have a single document of all the latest and necessary environment variables, to use all of our services.
