# Introduction

Framethrower enabled you to upload animations directly from Autodesk Maya onto our web platform! It was coded solely by [Jakob Kousholt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakobjk/) using React, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Qt and Python for Maya integration. It was running on Amazon Web Services using terraform as Infrastructure as Code!


Unfortunately, the project is no more, as ~$250 monthly server costs became a tad too expensive for a passion project that roughly 20 animators had fun using. I'd do a lot of things different for my next project, but it was a lot of fun, and I learned a lot.

I have decided not to polish things, and leave it unchanged when it was a private repo. Both for authenticity and nostalgia despite at the cost of appearing sloppy and unproffessonal at times, heh.

Below is a video of [Benjamin Kousholt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-kousholt-2112075/) going through submitting an animation in the early stages of the platform. Oh the memories :')
