        Clear communication is key when delivering feedback. Always seek to
        simplify and thoroughly explain your notes and maintain a professional
        and polite attitude. Remember; the aim is to leave the client with more
        knowledge and inspired to do more animation. Furthermore, be supportive
        and empathetic, “tough love” or ideas about how a rough tone is
        “industry standard so they may as well learn it here” are not helpful.
        This is not an attempt to shut down criticism or free speech, merely to
        underline that, with Framethrower, we’re aiming to cultivate a
        supportive and safe community, where members are eager to share their
        work, because the feedback will be encouraging, supportive and inspire
        them to grow and learn and pass on their knowledge in return.
      </p>

      <p className='my-4 mx-8'>
        Likewise, we at Framethrower commit to maintaining a supportive and
        professional tone with you, and expect the same in return. We’re all on
        the same team, and we will communicate with this in mind.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4 mx-8'>
        In the same vein we encourage openness and proactive communication. If
        you see anything on the site, which causes you to pause, or if you run
        into an issue, please let us know and please share your knowledge,
        solutions and valuable information with your fellow instructors, as our
        combined knowledge will be our biggest strength.
      </p>
      <p className='my-4 mx-8'>
        Finally, please remain professional, polite and respectful in your
        communication with others. Framethrower embraces diversity of gender,
        age, ethnicity, sexual orientation and culture. Disrespectful comments
        towards others, being clients, colleagues, members of the community or
        others will not be tolerated. If you witness such behavior, tell us
        immediately.
