          When reviewing the animation, we suggest you watch it through at least
          a few times before starting your feedback recording to get a feel of
          it and how you’d like to approach giving feedback. Some also find it
          helpful to note down immediate reactions on paper and start from there

        <li className='p-2'>
          When you’re ready to record your feedback, start OBS (screen capturing
          software), select the Framethrower pre sets provided above and record
          your feedback from the shot in the Framethrower animation player,
          using the feedback tools. Please remember to speak clearly, be
          specific, and maintain a professional and supportive tone. (For
          information on how to record using OBS and specs see video below.)
        </li>

        <li className='p-2'>
          When your feedback session has come to an end, stop the recording and
          save the video.
        </li>

        <li className='p-2'>
          Go to the “Submit Feedback” tab on the “Instructor” page and upload
          your video recording.
